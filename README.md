Drone flight controller for Arduino. 
This drone flight controller is for Arduino, it is based on the work done by Joop Brokking. You can find a lot of informations on his site
http://www.brokking.net/

This version will however not have the excact same code, a lot of the setup code hase been removed, and I make it possible to tune the PID parameters from a computer.

Currently working on cleaning up the code and ading startup and stop procedure

Next step will be to a GPS and magnotometer for additional functionallity, Not sure if I can stay on the Arduino UNO. GPS will for sure be located on a seperate nano or similar board.
