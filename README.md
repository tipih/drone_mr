Drone flight controller for Arduino. 
This drone flight controller is for Arduino, it is based on the work done by Joop Brokking. You can find a lot of informations on his site
http://www.brokking.net/

This version will however not have the excact same code, a lot of the setup code hase been removed, and I make it possible to tune the PID parameters from a computer.
